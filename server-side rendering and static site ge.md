server-side rendering and static site generation


A server-side rendered application enables pages to load faster, improving the user experience.

When rendering server-side, search engines can easily index and crawl content because the content can be rendered before the page is loaded, which is ideal for SEO. 

Webpages are correctly indexed because web browsers prioritize web pages with faster load times.

Rendering server-side helps efficiently load webpages for users with slow internet connection or outdated devices.





Rendering server-side can be costly and resource-intensive as it is not the default for JavaScript websites, and the server takes on the full burden of rendering content for users and bots.

While rendering static HTML server-side is efficient, rendering bigger, more complex applications server-side can increase load times due to the bottleneck.

Server-side rendering may not be compatible with third-party JavaScript code. 

Rendering server-side may be ideal for static site generation, but frequent server requests and full page reloads can result in overall slower page rendering in more complex applications.
